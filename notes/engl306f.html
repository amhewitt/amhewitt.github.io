        <div id='intro'><h3>What is Semiotics?</h3>
        
        <p><i>Semiotics</i> is the study of signs. The goal is to unravel meaning from all kinds of human products, like words, symbols, narratives, symphonies, paintings, comic books, scientific theories and mathematical theorems. </p>
        
        <p>More narrowly, semiotics focuses on the use, structure and function of signs (symbols, words, images, figures, etc). The central aim is to investigate, decipher, document, and explain the what, how, and why of signs, regardless of their simplicity or complexity.</p>
        
        <p>Semiotics studies how meaning is built into signs and texts of all kinds (words, symbols, drawings, musical compositions).</p>
        
        <p><i>Meaning</i> is a bit of a misleading term with multiple definitions. Danesi breaks the term up into three words, each with their own definitions.</p>
        
        <p><i>Reference</i> is the process of pointing out or identifying something. Words can have can refer to the same/similar things (<i>referents</i>). For example, the words 'rabbit' and 'hare' point to the same genus of animal.</p>
        
        <p><i>Sense</i> is what something elicits psychologically. We know that a hare is larger than a rabbit. It also has longer ears. A rabbit burrows, while a hare does not. So while the two words technically point to the same thing, there is a difference in what we would call a rabbit and a hare that is understood on more than an idiolectal level.</p>
        
        <p><i>Definition</i> is a statement about what something means by convention - put together by using words and other signs (often pictures).</p>
        
        <p><i>Denotation</i> and <i>connotation</i> are concepts in contemporary semiotics. Denotation is a replacement for reference, and connotation is a replacement for sense. Often, connotative meanings of words have roots in their denotative meanings (you can see this in the example 'square'.)</p>
        
        <p>Connotation is the operative sense-making and sense-extracting mode in the production and decipherment of creative texts (poems, novels, musical compositions, works of art). But also, many scientific theories and models involve connotative processes, even though they end up being interpreted denotatively over time. Abstract concepts are especially high in connotative content.</p>
        
        <p>Yet another way to express the same terms is <i>intension</i> (denotation) and <i>extension</i> (connotation).</p>
        
        <p><i>Image</i> is the mental picture of a referent that is evoked when a sign is used or suggested, and a <i>concept</i> is culture-specific interpretation that is assigned to the picture. There are two types of concepts: concrete (any referent that can be seen, heard, smelled, touched, or tasted - e.g., cat) and abstract (any refreent that cannot be perceived in any direct sensory way - e.g., love).</p>
        
        <p>There are many degrees or levels of concreteness. Semioticians generally agree on three. The <i>superordinate</i> level contains concepts that have a highly general classificatory function (e.g., mammal). The <i>prototypical</i> level, or the basic level, would then contain things like cat. The <i>subordinate</i> level is where more detailed ways of referring to something occur (e.g., Siamese).</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>There are two fundamental models of the sign. For the first, Saussure suggests that any true semiological science should include <i>synchronic</i> (studying sign systems at a given point in time - normally the present) and <i>diachronic</i> (how a sign system changes over time) components.</p>
        
        <p>Saussure put forward a binary model of the sign - a structure  with two components, physical (<i>signifer</i>, e.g., the sounds that make up a word) and conceptual (<i>signified</i>, e.g., the concept that the sign elicits).</p>
        
        <p>Peirce is best known for his view, pragmatism, that maintains that the significance of any theory or model lies in its application. The Peircean model is known as triadic, since it has three parts. The actual physical sign (<i>representamen</i>, something that does the representing), the thing to which it refers (<i>object</i>, something cast outside for observation), and the interpretation that it elicts in real-world situations (<i>interpretant</i>).</p>
        
        <p>He also developed a comprehensive typology of signs with 66 types in total. It's pretty confusing and newcomers to the field tend to be put off by it.</p>
        
        <p>Peirce viewed semiosis as originating in the perception of some property in an object. He called the act of sign creation or sign interpretation a 'firstness' event - a tendency to forge or interpret signs as simulations of the world. This is also called <i>iconicity</i>. Since iconic signs are fashioned in culture-specific contexts, their manifestations across cultures are not exactly alike, even though they spring from the same human perceptual apparatus - these manifestations are called <i>hypoicons</i>.</p>
        
        <p>A 'secondness' tendency in sign creation consists of relating objects in some way - this is called <i>indexicality</i>. The pointing finger is an example of this, known as an <i>index</i>. When we point ot something, we are relating it to our location as pointers. Close objects are 'near' or 'here'. Far objects are 'far' or 'there'.</p>
        
            <p>Peirce also posited the existence of a 'thirdness' tendency in sign creation, which consists in learning and using signs in conventional ways. Signs that result from this tendency are called <i>symbols</i>.</p></div>
        
        <div id='signs'><h3>Signs</h3>
        
        <p>As noted earlier, a <i>signifier</i> is something that stands for something else in some way. That 'something else' is the <i>signified</i>. Since a signifier refers to a signified, it follows that a signifier cannot exist without a signified, as the definition fails to be coherent in that case.</p>
        
        <p>Signs necessarily follow a structuralized format. Signs need to be both <i>paradigmatic</i> (distinctive) and <i>syntagmatic</i> (predictable). To recognize a signifier, and indeed its corresponding signified, one must recognize it as a sign in the first place.</p>
        
        <p>The <i>interpertant</i> addresses somebody. That is, it creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign. That sign which it creates, Danesi calls the interpretant of the first sign. In other words, the interpretant theoretically creates another signifier. The signified is not exact, and yet we can understand it.</p>
        
        <p>A <i>symptom</i> is a concept we are all familiar with, something such as pain, or hunger. Barthes posits that symptoms as pure signifiers with no meanings other than physiological ones. However, this can be countered with an animal understanding human symptoms (such as dogs being able to predict seizures and heart attacks) even when there is no outside sign that a symptom is even occurring.</p>
        
        <p>There are many types of signals. One such example is <i>kinesics</i>. Put in laymen terms, kinesics is picking up on bodily cues that a species exhibes. For example, birds have a natural type of coo, but they adapt to their environment and other calls from different species of birds. There is also the Clever Hans effect, that shows that horses tend to pick up on their owners' expressions. Human semiosis is characterized by a constant interplay among nature, inventiveness, and culture.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p><i>Icons</i> are signs that have been constructed to resemble their referents in some way. The reference is the object or event to which a term or symbol refers. The immediate object is what is being modelled, and the dynamic object (can be more than one) is the referent that can be modelled based off of the immediate object. Some examples of icons are roman numerals. A <i>skeumorph</i> is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues, or attributes, from structures that are inherent to the original.</p>
        
        <p>An <i>index</i> is a sign that involves relation of some kind. Typically, it places two or more referents in relation to each other. The relation can be location-based, temporal (time-based), identification based, or organizational based.</p>
        
        <p>As referred to earlier, an example of an index are the words <i>near, far, here, </i>and <i>there</i>. Pronouns are also indexes, as well as orderings (Dewey decimal, alphabetical, chronological), facial cues, weather phenomenon, and more.</p>
        
        <p>Quite simply, a <i>symbol</i> is a sign that stands for something in a conventional way. Some examples are logos, hand gestures (peace), colours, and flags.</p>
        
            <p>A <i>name</i> is a sign that has both indexical and symbolic value. They are indexical in that they identify a person in some relational way (in relation to a kinship group, to a particular social context, etc) and they are symbolic in that they are based on specifc cultural traditions. The intersection of semiotics and linguistics is known as <i>onomastics</i>.</p></div>
        
        <div id='structures'><h3>Structures</h3>
        
        <p><i>Structure</i> is the order and arrangement of parts, or signs, to allow us to interpert them. It relies on both our ability to tell the difference between parts (or signs), and our ability to know how they fit together.</p>
        
        <p>There are two different types of structures. A <i>paradigmatic</i> structure is a structural relation between signs that keeps them distinct, and therefore exclusively recognizable. A <i>syntagmatic</i> structure is a structural relation that guides the combination of signs in a coherent way.</p>
        
        <p><i>Associative</i> structure is the derivation of abstract meaning (see above for more on what abstract means in this context). Associative structure is not constrained structurally and there is linkage from inferred commonality.</p>
        
        <p>An <i>image schema</i> is a recurring structure of perceptual interactions that portray locations, shapes, and the like. They typically consist of orientation, containment, and perception of work.The <i>idealized cognition model</i> involves cognitive clustering. It conveys the same concept through different vehicles. <i>Radiation</i> involves imagining abstract concepts as conveying one another directly. It conveys different things through the same vehicle.</p>
        
        <p><i>Structural economy</i> is the simplification and reduction of signs based on three things: convenience, frequency of use, and time of existence.</p>
        
        <p><i>Structuralism</i> is a school of thought that states that structure mirrors perception and reality, while <i>post-structuralism</i> is a school of thought that states that signs construct reality. The three functions of language in post-structuralism is as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Cognitive: to convey factual information</li>
        <li>Expressive: to convey mood or attitiude</li>
        <li>Conative: to convey an attempt to influence</li>
            </ul></div>
        
        
        <div id='codes'><h3>Codes</h3>
        
        <p>A <i>code</i> is a system of signs that are perceptibly distinct and that can be combined in specifci ways to make other composite signs. Alphabet systems are good examples of codes. There are two types of codes - <i>natural codes</i> that are formed or produced by nature (eg. genetic code), and <i>conventional codes</i> which are produced by cultural-specific events, practices, traditions and so on (eg. alphabet).</p>
        
        <p>Conventional codes govern all aspects of human intellectual and social ilfe. In order to make contact with someone successfully, we must know the appropriate haptic and language codes, which provide the forms (words, expressions) and the rules for combining them that make interaction possible in the first place.</p>
        
        <p>Three features define codes. <i>Representationality</i> implies that signs and the rules for combinng them in codes can be used to represent something. The end result of representation is a text of some kind that contains a message. <i>Interpretability</i> implies that messages can be understood successfully only by someone who is privy to the signs and the rules of the codes used to construct them. <i>Contextualization</i> implies that message interpretation is affected by the context in which it occues.</p>
        
        <p>Conventional codes bear evidence of the contextualized experience of communities. For example, many Inuit languages have multiple specialized words for the animal seal.</p>
        
        <p>Codes are characterized by (binary and otherwise) opposition. As is common with binaries, there is one side that tends to be more common than the other, and the more common one is assumed to be the default. The described form is known as the <i>unmarked</i> form (right handed people, maleness, etc) and the other side is known as the <i>marked</i> form (left handed people, femaleness, etc). Which side of the binary is known as unmarked is itself open to context. In some languages, the feminine gender is the unmarked one.</p>
        
        <p><i>Social codes</i> underlie social communication and interaction. An example of such a code is how far people will stand from each other when greeting one another. This will differ based on cultural factors and who the two people are in relation to each other.</p>
        
        <p><i>Mythic codes</i> underlie the typical structure of a mythic hero, also known as a hero code. Heroes are typically strong, superhuman, have a tragic flaw, etc.</p>
        
        <p><i>Knowledge codes</i> allow for the representation and communication of knowledge of various kinds - logical, mathematical, scientific, philosophical, classifcatory, legal, etc. An example of this is trigonometry and all of the laws that surround it.</p>
        
        <p>The type of vocabulary that develops in a specific language is largely a matter of cultural emphasis, need, or tradition. In addition, codes and their contextualizations mediate perception, as can be seen by multiple kinds of optical illusions that work in some parts of the world and not in others.</p>
        
            <p>The culture is also often called the <i>semiosphere</i>. It regulates and shapes perception and cognition. Humans have the ability to shape the semiosphere at any time they want. Humans live in the semiosphere, so they are bound to perceive only a small part of what constitutes reality and are constantly inventing new signs, texts and codes to fill in those knowledge gaps.</p></div>
        <div id='texts'>
        <h3>Texts</h3>
        
        <p>A <i>text</i> is a larger sign, such as a novel, painting, a piece of music, and the like. Put into Saussure's equation, it might look something like the following:</p>
        
        <p><code>text = message(meaning) / smaller signifiers</code></p>
        
        <p>Another way of looking at texts is that they are composite structures consisting of smaller sign elements. They can be understood in two ways: <i>linearly</i> (through the discoursive process, piece by piece) or <i>holistically</i> (presentational process, assessing as a whole). This, however, does not stop a text from being both.</p>
        
        <p><i>Textuality</i> is the ability to create and understand texts. There are many types of textualites.</p>
        
        <ul><li>Subtextuality - embedding of a text within the main text through allusion</li>
        <li>Intertextuality - connection to other texts through inference or another means</li>
        <li>Paratext - physical or conventional characteristics associated with texts</li>
        <li>Architext - the prototype from which similar texts are derived</li>
        <li>Hypotext - a text based on another text, but one that alters, elaborates, or extends it, which differentiates it from intertext</li>
        <li>Hypertext - a text within a main text that is designed to explain it or provide further information (think of a web page)</li></ul>
        
        <p>In the past, some key parts of communication were recognized as: an addresser, a message, an addressee, a context, a mode, and a code.</p>
        
        <p>There are several communicative functions. <i>Emotive</i> is the addresser's intent. <i>Conative</i> function is the effect the message is, or is supposed to, have. The <i>referential</i> function is a message constructed to convey information. The <i>poetic</i> function delivers meaning iconically or poetically. The <i>phatic</i> function is messages which establish social relations, and the <i>metalingual</i> function is a message referring to the code used.</p>
        
        <p><i>Narrative texts</i> are narratives and everyday discourse made up of <i>actants</i>. An actant could be a subject, an object or person of desire, an opponent, a helper, a dispatcher of the desired object, a receiver, and a conclusion of the story. Out of all of the narrative texts that exists, those of myth are of particular interest.</p>
        
        <p>A <i>visual text</i> is an iconic representation of a concept using a combination of points, lines, and shapes. They are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the order and fashion in which we assemble them that gives them meaning.</p>
        
        <p>Visual texts are made up of and enhanced by several <i>visual signifeirs.</i> One such signifier is <i>value</i>, which is how light or dark a line or shape is drawn or represented, which carries meaning and connotation outside of the line or shape itself. Lightly drawn lines implies whimps, while dark ones imply gloominess. The type of shading also carries connotation, some methods of shading like cross hatching is standard in scientifc diagrams.</p>
        
        <p><i>Colour</i> conveys feeling, mood and atmosphere. These follow the rules of colour theory (analogous, complementary, warm and cool colours, etc) as well as hold cultural significance that makes them mean different things in different cultures.</p>
        
        <p><i>Texture</i> is the use of visual forms to evoke certain sensations. Smooth lines are calming, jagged lines are unpleasant.</p>
        
        <p>Some examples of visual texts are charts and diagrams.</p>
            </div>
        <div id='representations'><h3>Representations</h3>
        
        <p>A quick review: Representations serve a human need to explore and understand the world in meaningful ways. The language one speaks and the context in which they are trained and live their life shapes one's perception of the world.</p>
        
        <p>Representations of a thing will impact the way that the interpertant conceptualizes the thing.</p>
        
        <p><i>Representation</i> is defined as the activity of making texts, exploring the world with your mind ranther than your body. If a sign is defined as something standing for something else in some way, then representation is the "in some way" part.</p>
        
        <p>Representation is constrained and shaped by social conventions, communal experience, and other contextual (culture-specifci representations, the medium in which the sign is being conveyed, and cultural views) factors. In addition, the chosen medium will convey a different level of information. A video conveys more detail than a picture. This all results in varying representations of something that people often take for granted as universal experiences.</p>
        
        <p><b>Representation and Myth</b></p>
        
        <table style="width:100%"><tr><th>The Mythic Hero</th><th>Superman</th></tr><tr><td>Sent/banished by the gods</td><td>Comes from another planet where very powerful beings lived</td></tr><tr><td>Embodies all the virtues idealized at the time. Often honesty, strength, etc</td><td>Embodies goodness, truth, justice, and the American way</td></tr><tr><td>One tragic flaw (Achilles' heel, Samson's hair)</td><td>One vulnerability - Kryptonite, but is otherwise all powerful</td></tr></table>
        
        <p><i>Myth</i> refers to orignial codes: archetypal characters, narratives, and tropes therein. <i>Mythologies</i> refers to how those mythical ideals manifest in modern day culture.</p>
        
        <p>Mythologies shape lives shape mythologies. The early industrial revolution conceptualization of a child just pictured them as physically stunted adults, since they often had the same responsibilities and were expected to behave like their adults. As the revolution progressed, children were no longer required to be in the workforce. As aresult, a new mythology springs up about how children are innocent and need to be protected/sheltered from the reality of the world, needed time to play to be healthy, needed a school environment, etc. This is a conceptualization that is very different from adults. Studies then find that children are very different from adults, and needed time to develop through play, a school environment, etc.</p>
        
        <p>(It is important to note that the images of children as pure or innocent is a part of mythology, not psychology or sociology of childhood. A child has no awareness of being pure or innocent. That is an awareness that only adults hold.)</p>
        
        <p>There are differing views on how representation interacts with reality. Is representation "an attempt to encode reality", or is it "an illusory practice designed to impart sense to life, which otherwise would have none"? The <i>deconstructionist</i> view is that representation is illusory and makes no sense, while the <i>structuralist</i> view is that representation allows us to explore and discover reality, both purposefully and accidentally.</p>
        
        <p>For example, is math invented or discovered? Numbers and math are created to represent how we see the world. We tend to intuitively find patterns that turn out to be much more interesting than they initally appear. Discoveries are not a result of the search for truth, but the recognition and explration of unexpected effects.</p>
            </div>
            
        <div id='applications'><h3>Applications</h3>
        
        <p>Some semiotic notions are the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>"Signs are not tokens of knowledge but representations of knowledge" - Danesi. Study of sytems through TV shows, movies, philosophy, science, anthropology, history, etc.</li>
        <li>Each structure consists of an internal framework.</li></ul>
        
        <p>It's also worth it to explore how objects and signs generate meaning.</p>
        
        <p>There are three imperative questions. Firstly, what does the sign mean? Second, how does the sign encode meaning? And finally, why does it mean what it means?</p>
        
        <p><i>Historical inquiry</i> serves to unravel how cultural products came into existence, while <i>connotative inquiry</i> serves to figure out what something means culturally, while delving into its connotations. For saluting is associated with the military subculture, while the 3-fingered salute (as seen in The Hunger Games) is a modification of the original salute to denounce oppression.</p>
        
        <p>There are several applications in the realm of clothing. Ethics of nudity, gender performance (manipulating our appearance to suit our identity and the social implications that that carries), uniform, and social standing / hierarchies.</p>
        
        <p>Social etiquette also carries semiotic value. There is a weird psychology around doing human things around other people, such as eating and farting. There is also the element of interpersonal relationships and how this changes how we interpret certain things depending on who it comes from and their connection to us.</p>
        
        <p>Miscellany includes the use of anthropomorphism in media (how we decode animal patterns and parallel them with human characteristics, and draw on animal imagery to allegorize our lived experience) as well as marketing (there is potential here to mould semiotic spaces around products).</p>
        
        <p>In our quest for meaning, we find commonality in the overall system fo meaning that defines existence for understanding social phenomenon. We also modify old signs, replace, iterate on, and improve them (people like artists, scientists and writers might spend their entire lives doing just this). There is also the lement of instinctive meaning making vs. cultural signs, such as the conception of health - lovesickness, cancer, mental illness...</p>
        
            <p>Semiotics is a dynamic, vibrant, ever-changing science, and it is enriching to understand the multi-layered fabric of society through semiotic discourse.</p></div></section>

        <div id='memes'><h2><i>Memes as Speech Acts</i> - Grundligh</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        
        <p><I>Meme</I> - based on ancient Greek <i>mimema</i>, which means "something imitated". An internet meme is a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains influence through online transmission. Milner also defines it as an "amateur media artifact, extensively remixed and recirculated by different participants on social media network".</p>
        
        <p><i>Speech acts</i> are central to communication. When we communicate with others, we use speech acts to communicate and understand the message being transmitted. Semiotics provides evidence that non-verbal communication is interpreted in much the same way as verbal communication. Argument of the paper is as follows: <i>a non-verbal (i.e. a reaction picture only) meme can still be a speech act, as long as the context of the non-verbal message is understood by the addressee.</i></p>
        
        <h3>Multimodality</h3>
            
        <p><i>Multimodality</i> is an interdisciplinary approach drawn from social semiotics that understands communication and representation as more than language and attends systematically to the social interpretation of a range of forms of making meaning. It places emphasis on the importance of social context as well as the resources available for meaning making. With memes, the choice of resource and social context in which the meme is interpreted are central to successful communication, since communication through memes is dependent on the addressee understanding why a certain meme was used to comment on something.</p>
            
            <p>The meanings in any mode is always interwoven with the meanings made with those of other modes cooperating in the communicative ensemble. The interaction between modes is itself a part of the production of meaning. In the cases of memes, the meme itself qualifies as a mode which is distributed through social media.</p>
            
            <h3>Semiotic Resources</h3>
            
            <p><i>Semiotic resources</i> have a meaning potential, based on their past uses, and a set of affordances based on their possible uses. These will be actualized in concrete social contexts where their use is subject to some form of semiotic regime.</p>
            
            <p>A meme has a meaning potential - every meme is created with the purpose of communicating something, whether an emotion or an opinion. In the context in which memes are used, the interpretation of the meme will depend on the knowledge of memes, their functions, and their uses.</p>
            
            <p>The interpretation of a meme can be seen as a process of signifcation. Because memes are multimodal and they can be interpreted semiotically, it's possible for them to communicate a message that is more complex than the sum of their parts.</p>
            
            <h3>Speech Acts</h3>
            
            <p><i>Pragmatics</i> - study of what speakers mean. Communication depends on recognizing what speakers mean by their utterances. Intended meaning plays a huge role.</p>
            
            <p>When you utter a sentence, you are not only saying something, but you are also doing something. For example, you're making a committment, or apologising, or something else.</p>
            
            <p>Trichotomy of different speech acts. <i>Locutionary act</i> - production of sounds and the production of words. <i>Illocutionary act</i> - performing one of the functions of the language (saying something). <i>Perlocutionary act</i> - refers to the effects, intended or not, that result from saying something. Another way to look at this is speaker (S), hearer (H), expression (e), language (L) and context (C). Then an utterance can be defined as "S utters e from L to H in C".</p>
            
            <p>If an addresse is not able to recognize the speech act, successful communication is not possible. In every utterance, expectations are created which serve us in understanding later conversation. These assist us in responding appropriately and identifying when and where a conversation goes wrong.</p>
            
            <p>Two important factors in recognizing a speech act and responding to it correctly - intention and context.</p>
            
            <h3>Intention and Inference</h3>
            
            <p><i>Intention</i> is that which the speaker wants the hearer or reader to recognize in a communication. They are essential to communication just as structure and meaning.</p>
            
            <p>Inferece depends on <i>mutual contextual beliefs</i>, <i>linguistic presumption</i> and <i>communicative presumption</i> (language sharing, and mutual recognizability of illocutionary intent). The interpertation is only possible because the subparts of the utterance interact meaningfully with the information that is already present in the discourse situation and the subparts also interact meaningfully with one another.</p>
            
            <h3>Context</h3>
            
            <p>Before being able to ascribe a particular meaning to any utterance, a hearer must have a clear idea of the context in which such an utterance occurs.</p>
            
            <p>There are three aspects to context. The first are <i>the roles of the conversational participants</i> (including the speaker, the addressee, the agent affected by the utterance, and the hearers). The second is the <i>assumed common ground</i> (set of background facts, beliefs and assumptions assumed to be privy to the participants). The third is the act of making the utterance itself.</p>
            
            <h3>Memes</h3>
            
            <p>The number of standard meme types is actually quite small. Standard memes that become popular and are used regularly on the internet are established through shared pathways that create a "sense of community in a fragmented world".</p>
            
            <p>Certain types of memes are easier to interpret as speech acts than others and are also used with more frequency. We focus on two types.</p>
            
            <p>There is a taxonmoy of 13 types of memes that can be seperated into two groups: <i>remixed images</i> (single images, and stacked images) and <i>stable images</i>. We are only concerned with <i>image macros</i>, which are captioned images that typically consist of a picture and a witty message/catchphrase, typically with text above and below the image in the macro. There are also <i>reaction shots</i>, which are image macros with variation in structure or without text.</p>
            
            <p>Image macros become standard when they are used over and over again.</p>
            
            <H3>Functions and Interpretations of Memes</H3>
            
            <p>Memes are used in networks of mediated cultural participation as multimodal artifacts to tell a joke, make an observation or advance an argument. While the goal of an image macro is mostly to be funny, it can be used to communicate something more serious.</p>
            
            <p>The same memes can use different text to communicate advice, humour, emotions, etc. Memes are open, collaborative and adaptable; and countless particpants circulate and transform memes on amateur metworks of mediated cultural participation. With each new remix, mees are appropriated in order to produce new iterations and variations of broader ideas.</p>
            
            <h3>Memes as Speech Acts</h3>
            
            <p>Six types of illocutionary acts (<i>constatives, directives, commissives, and acknowledges</i> as communicative acts, and <i>effectives and verdictives</i> as conventional acts).</p>
            
            <p><i>Constatives</i> express the speaker's belief and intention or desier that the hearer have or form a like belief.</p>
            
            <p><i>Directives</i> express the speaker's attitiude toward some prospective action by the hearer and his intention that the utterance or its attitude be taken as a reason for the hearer's action.</p>
            
            <p><i>Commissives</i> express the speaker's intention and belief that the utterances obligates them to do something.</p>
            
            <p><i>Acknowledgements</i> express feelings regarding the hearer's intention that the utterances satisfy a social expectation to express certain feelings, and their belief that it does.</p>
            
            <p>Memes, although different from traditional communication, still make use of a creator and receiver. Even though they are often jokes, they can communicate important information and opinions. As in all speech acts, the context and the intent of the creator also plays an important role in the understanding of memes.</p>
            
            <p>Most of the meme functions can be grouped under the communicative acts, more specifcally constative illucationary acts. Memes can be created for specific and personal purposes, such as a request, a thank-you... The possibilities with memes are endless, so any of the acts mentioned above could apply.</p>
            
            <p>Memes are typically used to communicate a joke but can contain serious content as well (henceforth referred to as humourous comments/opinions).</p>
            
            <h3>Memes as Jokes</h3>
            
            <p>Memes are often used to joke about something or someone.</p>
            
            <p>A joke is a violation of the rules governing an illocutionary act, since they depend on the ambiguity of utterances as illocutionary acts, and the speech act is open to misinterpretation or is otherwise vague. The simplest structure of a joke includes a set-up, an incongruity and a resolution, and the disjunction occurs at the incongruity (<i>punchline</i>). In memetic terms, the top part of the macro is the set-up and the bottom part the punchline.</p>
            
            <p>Jokes are often used to mask a more serious issue or offer a critcism to someone in power.</p>
            
            <h3>Memes as Opinions and Comments</h3>
            
            <p>Humour is often an easy vessel to communicate an opinion, especially as it pertains to current events that might be controversial. The positive functions of humour (to liberate/enhance solidarity) may be disguised for the exercises of power. We might express out aggression towards political figures through the use of humour, but they still remain in power throughout.</p>
            
            <p>It is important to keep in mind that the model reader of the meme must have knowledge of the background of the issue or situation depicted in the meme for communication to be successful in this front. Thus there is more background information that must be made clear to both parties when compared to other ways that mees can stand in as speech acts.</p>
            
            <h3>Memes as Questions</h3>
            
            <p>Memes used to ask questions or to question something often include humour and should not always be seen as serious. However, the questions themselves can lead to debate sometimes. The illocutionary acts in play here are constatives and directives.</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <p>Both pragmatics and semiotics offer support for the interpretation of memes from a linguistic perspective. Semiotics offer information on how the media and modes that memes consits of can be interpreted and how the characteristics of semiotic resources apply to memes. Pragmatics offers information on how memes could function as speech acts.</p>
            
            <p>Communication using memes is more complex than expected. Not only are memes media artefacts that can be remixed and reused, but the model reader is not always present. Social media users who have enough knowledge of memes and how they are used are able to use them to communicate effectively.</p>

                <h2><i>#whitewashed</i> - Nguyen</h2>
                
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                
                <p><i>Twitter</i> is a microblogging platform and a social media website that allows users to maintain interpersonal relationships and form virtual communities. Users may <i>follow</i> one another and in doing so, subscribe to online entities.</p>
                
                <p>Part of the unique linguistic makeup of the Twitter vernacular is the use of the <i>hashtag</i> <code>#</code>. Hashtags allow users to track ongoing conversations, mark the topic of their conversations, and to convey humour and irony. Above all, they are used to signify membership in a group. Hashtags enable users to search topics that interest them and to find other users that share their associated values.</p>
                
                <p>Twitter users can also use <i>mentions</i> <code>@</code> to direct a public message to another user.</p>
                
                <p>Using Twitter as a microcosm for computer-mediated linguistic exchange can thusly be helpful.</p>
                
                <p>The paper aims to answer the following questions:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>What behaviours in their day to day lives do Twitter users convey as 'ethnic' or 'non-ethnic' to a given audience?</li>
                    <li>Why might Twitter users reinforce internalized racism by using these hashtags?</li>
                    <li>What social capital do users gain from marking their behaviours as authenically or inauthentically ethnic, if any?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Defining Terms</h3>
                
                <p>This paper mainly deals with the term <i>whitewashed</i> as well as some other related terms. Whitewashed has a few different meanings. It originally referred to the action of painting over something with plaster. It then took on the metaphorical meaning of omission or covering up something that had a blemish or fault. In more abstract terms, the obfuscation of information. It also carries meaning in an athletic context. For a team to whitewash another means to shut them out.</p>
                
                <p>The term whitewash also carries racialized meanings. One meaning references how Hollywood and other popular media upholds Eurocentric (white) standards of beauty above all others. Another refers to the depiction of white people on book covers instead of people of colour even when the characters being portrayed are described as people of colour in the source material.</p>
                
                <p>The meaning this paper is concerned with is whitewashed as a negative racial identity marker. The use of the term to mean "to cover up" influences its use as a pejorative racial identity marker. It then takes on the meaning of 'being perceived as too assimilated to American culture' or 'to any combination of a loss/abandonment of ethnic heritage, cultural practices, or the language of one's parents'. It is also occasionally synonymous with the expression <i>acting white</i>, which refers to being perceived as performing an identity that closely aligns with the dominant culture in one's community. The term is them described as <i>intraethnic othering</i>, which involves the ridicule and isolation of some coethnics by deeming certain individuals as having sold out to the white mainstream.</p>
                
                <p>In contrast to this term is <i>fobby</i>, which is avariant of the noun FOB ("fresh off the boat") used to describe the act of being 'too foreign', too associated with immigrant culture, not correctly assimilating into the culture of the majority.</p>
                
                <p>These two terms together frame the borders of performed ethnic identites, as both terms are negative identity markers that force indivduals to strive for an 'acceptable bicultural middle'. The concept of this has its roots in internalized racism.</p>
                
                <p><I>Internalized racism</I> reinforces racial oppression as a whole by working from the inside out. It can be defined as 'the subjection of the victims of racism to the very racist ideology which imprisons and defines them'. It occurs when ethnic minorities use the racist stereotypes imposed upon them against one another or to themselves, to other certain individuals as authentically or inauthentically ethnic, or to discern who is in the 'in group' or who has 'sold out' to the majority culture. Individuals who do not perform the bicultural middle to satisfaction are thusly shunned.</p>
                
                <p>It is important to note that internalized racism is not a cultural or biological characteristic of a subjugated group but is the result of multiple systems of oppression and domination from a white-dominated society. Oppressed ethnic individuals are led to believe that they can assimilate to the majority culture by abandoning their claims over their ethnic identity and distancing themselves from others in their ethnic group. On the other hand, some instances of internalized racism will lead individuals to value those who are more 'authentically ethnic' over those who are not. In many cases, being 'genuinely ethnic' is more valuable than selling out to the dominant group.</p>
                
                <p>Internalized racism begins when the oppressed accept the identites imposed on them by oppressors, when individuals begin to enforce racial stereotypes amongst themselves and amongst peers within their ethnic groups. It can be considered a dualism where 'the culture, the values, and the areas of life associated with the dualized are systematically and pervasively constructed and depicted as inferior'.</p>
                
                <h3>Data Discussion</h3>
                
                <p>Twitter is amicroblogging platform, so the data turns up more colloquial uses of <code>#whitewashed</code> that refer to its racial connotations. The hashtag plays both the role of a discourse marker, and an evaluative metacomment on the content of the tweet.</p>
                
                <p>Ethnic jokes police the social, geographical, and moral boundaries of a group. These boundaries don't just define who is a member and who is not, but they also describe acceptable (in group) behaviour and unaacceptable (outsider) behaviour. This is how both <code>#fobby</code> and <code>#whitewashed</code> delineate membership amon those who are authentically and inauthentically ethnic, as they both work to mock ethnic minorities who are peripheral to a dominant group - either a group that consists of mainly members of an ethnic minority, or a group that is predominately white. In addition, both the terms are framed as a caricatured binary.</p>
                
                <p>When a user labels their own actions as <code>#whitewashed</code>, they are acknowledging that hteir actions are incongruent with what they perceive to be authentic actions of their ethnic group. They are broadcasting their own inauthentic ethnicity, as it may. At the same time, it communicates to the outgroup that the user is not authentically ethnic, but they also are not white at the same time - they are merely (in their eyes) poorly imitating whiteness.</p>
                
                <p>How does one benefit socially from self-identifying as <code>#whitewashed</code> or <code>#fobby</code>? It's possible that the hashtags are used to mediate the demands of meeting a bicultural middle by cynically broadcasting their failure to do so.</p>
                
                <p>In the first, the comment is meant to derive sympathy by being self-deprecating about their 'inauthentic' performance of their identity. However, they're also able to play to the dominant group by displaying how distant they are from their ethnic group.</p>
                
                <p>By contrast, by self-marking as fobby, they acknowledge their membership in the ethnic group and make known their sense of belonging while joking about it to the dominant group, caricaturizing themselves into the stereotypes imposed by others.</p>
                
                <p>This binary framework is how internalized racism works to oppress subjugated minorities with respect to their personal conceptions of their own identities. They are 'kept in line' so to speak, by policnig each other to meet the expectations of the dominant group. The hashtag amplifies this by making their group affiliations seen to public audiences. Makes sense, when you consider that people speak to be understood, but also to be believed, obeyed, respected, and distinguished. With that in mind it is 'best' to make such an announcement as loud as possible.</p>
                
                <p>Overall the two hashtags work in tandem to mark ethnic minorities as others, showing that the dominated have no indivduality or singularity, and particularities attributed to their group suffice to define them completely. The behaviours of people of colour are always marked and thus subject to overgeneralization.</p>
                
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                
                <p>The existence of the aformentioned tags allow us to see that Twitter data are observable proxies for how ethnic identities are framed by internalized racism. The term is closely linked with negative stereotypes surrounding immigration that perpetuate the xenophobia that often shapes the dominant perceptions of ethnic minorities.</p>
                
                <p>We also see that the behaviours of people of colour are always marked through these hashtags. One is either fobby or whitewashed, and the bicultural middle acts as a seemingly unobtainable middle ground that one may never actually meet. In addition, there is no behaviour that people of colour can perform that is considered unmarked. By using the Twitter data to study institutions of oppression, such as internalized racism, we can see how ethnic identities and power relationships are maintained through langauge and social discourse, and how the social media sphere facilitates such maintenance.</p>

            <h2><i>Eleanor Rigby</i> - Graham, Luttrell</h2>
                
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                
                <p>Analysis on the rhetorical function of string arrangements in popular music from the perspective of Burke's 'rhetoric of identification'. Demonstrating how the 'organizational' dimension of semiosis works in music in relation to historical functions of style. <i>Style</i> in this context refers to the concept of a genre. In its simplest form, style is ingratiation, an attempt to gain favour by saying the right thing in the right context. It is a form of <i>etiquette</i>, which is itself court ceremony and ceremonious forms.</p>
                
                <p>Popular music was at first assumed to be a low art form that could not be a serious cultural form. By the mid 1960s, with the help of The Beatles' Eleanor Rigby, it was clear that this was not the case. The song was a popular form by a rock band dressed in the high classical garb of a small ensemble string arrangement (defined as Western Classical style). The choice of using a string arrangement was as much a rhetorical choice as it was a stylistic one, to associate popular music with high art forms. To generalize, string arrangement styles in popular music can be viewed as <i>rhetoric formations</i> - they reference and instantiate specific institutions, simultaneously identifying with them and claiming their cultural legitimacy. Eleanor Rigby sraws opton the institutions of Western classical music to reorder the cultural position of popular music genres, which have their roots in church and monarchy, and later in bourgeoisie institutions of high culture.</p>
                
                <p>Demonstrate how a critcal analysis of musical style can help us understand the reordering of cultural and political institutions more generally.</p>
                
                <h3>Definitions</h3>
                
                <p><i>Popular music</i> refers to the diverse selection of commercial music typically positioned as distinct from/opposed to classical music. Refers to the recorded musical forms made popular after WW2 which underpinned the rise of mass consumer culture.</p>
                
                <p><i>Style</i> is functionally distinct to <i>genre</i>. The former may be understood in relation to a dialectic between universal in particular. That is to say, <i>genre</i> refers to a more general nomenclature given to songs and albums that connect under a common aesthetic. Instead of talking about sub-genres, we will talk about <i>styles</i>.</p>
                
                <p>Prior to Eleanor Rigby, rock and roll music occupied an order of piety that associated it with youth rebellion, a rejection of the status quo, and a newly consumerized youth - counter-cultural to classical music. By using the string arrangement used in the song, The Beatles brought two incongruous orders together. Such a meshing can provide a useful lens on historical transformations of music and its place in the context of reordered cultural and political hierarchies.</p>
                
                <p>The <i>organizational metafunction</i> is defined as "the construction of relations between elements of the discourse itself, so that it is interpretable as having structure, texture, and informational organization and relative promnoence across meaningful stretches of text, and from text to text".</p>
                
                <p><i>Production</i> is defined as the technical and artistic processes involves in recording, editing, mixing, and mastering music for sale to consumers. <i>Arrangement</i> is the process of placing new musical material in time and space to elaborate and add to a composition. This is not to be confused with <i>orchestration</i>, which means taking material a composer has created and translating it to a new set of conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>Semiotics, Rhetoric, Music, and Meaning</h3>
                
                <p>Synthesis of social semiotic and rhetorical perspectives.</p>
                
                <p>The rhetorical perspective is grounded in epideitic or performative rhetoric. By the fourteenth century, rhetoric was 'the dominant model for artistic creation of any sort'. By the late renaissance period, style was 'commonly interpreted in terms of ornament, the writer or speaker was thought of as decorating their otherwise plain thought with tropes, figures, or schemes'. Style is therefore shared by all the arts.</p>
                
                <p>Burke takes epideixis (performance) into a new direction, defining a new perspective on rhetoric concerned with the links between style, performance, identification, and social hierarchy. Science is a 'preparation for action', and a rhetorical utterance is 'an inducement to action'. The introduction of classical styles into popular music can be seen as a means of, first, changing establishment attitudes towards a 'low' form of music to be seen as a higher form. </p>
                
                <p>From a semiotic perspective, the introduction of classical styles into popular msuic is an implicit claim for seeing the popular form as the new musical representative of Western culture more generally. In order to be representative of a culture, creators of cultural material must grasp the principle behind the ordering of the insignia rather than just imitating it. Eleanor Rigby demonstrates both the principles of classical arrangement and orchestration and the hierarchical implications of releasing such a piece.</p>
                
                <h3>Corpus Analysis for Style Definitions</h3>
                
                <p>Seven styles of string arrangements:</p>

                <p>None of the string styles are clear cut or deliberately unambiguous, they overlap and become hard to distinguish in some cases.</p>
                
                <h3>Metafunctional Description of the Western Classical Style</h3>
                
                <p>More on the <i>Western Classical Style</i> (WCS). Based on rules established during the CPE, which includes the Baroque and Classical periods of Western art music. As such it is also associated with the institutions such as the monarchy, aristocracy, and church of renaissance and late feudal era Europe.</p>
                
                <h4>Presentational Features</h4>
                
                <p><i>Presentational metafunction</i> is the discourse community's typical ways of constructing participants, processes, relations, and circumstances standing in particular semantic relations to one another across meaningful stretches of text, and from text to text. WCS is presented according to strict rules established during the CPE and curated through the conservatiore system. WC arrangements are typically <i>diatonic</i>, using keys to organize melody and harmony, have equal temperament tuning systems, and are built from a prescribed system of relationships between chords and melodies.</p>
                
                <p>Performance is strictly controlled by aesthetic and rectitude rules which embody the meticulous relationship this style has with executing notation correctly (that is, according to established conventions). Pure tones are favoured, ornamentation is kept to a minimum, and rhythms are executed strictly.</p>
                
                <h4>Orientational Features</h4>
                
                <p><i>Orientational dimension of meaning</i> refers to attitudes toward present and potential addresses and audiences, and towards the presentational content of our discourse, in respect of social relations and evaluations from a particular viewpoint, across meaningful stretches of text and from text to text.</p>
                
                <p>As far as WCS is concerned, the Orientational features typically articulate values of formality, seriousness, cultural gravity, and legitimacy, the values of the institutions from which it historically emerges.</p>
                
                <h4>Organizational Features</h4>
                
                <p><i>Organizational metafunction</i> is that which rhetorically generates coherence and cohesion, such that discourse is interpretable as having structure, texture, and informational organization and relative prominence across meaningful stretches of text and from text to text.</p>
                
                <p>As far as WCS is concerned, individual examples gain coherence through identification with the institutions of church, mocarchy, aristocracy within which the style was developes, and in the CPE-focused educational institutions where rules and values of the style are maintained.</p>
                
                <h3>Eleanor Rigby in Particular</h3>
                
                <p>The Beatles came from working class beginnings, they began their careers playing a culturally maligned form of music that intially offended the conservative British establishment, they voiced anti establishment attitudes, and they promoted alternative and controversial approached to living (nonviolence, psychedelics, transcendental religious practices...). In addition, their social roots were lampooned by the conservative establishment. All of this adds up to an irrespectable band writing irrespectable, "barely coherent" music.</p>
                
                <p>While Yesterday is most written about as the Classical turning point for the Beatles, Eleanor Rigby is the point at which the band makes a fearless statement that includes no other instrumentation than an octet. This in effect, says "this <i>is</i> classical music". The way the instruments were recorded was very atypical for the style. In fact, the musicians were watching the recording happen with horror. The vibrato was very minmial, more in line with historical performance practice approaches. This was considerd a revolutionary move, something that had not been seen in pop recordings.</p>

                <h3>Preamble</h3>
                
                <p>'Cult classic' movie released in 1998, a sequel to 'Fargo'. Lots of lines and iconography that resonated with a large audience after the release of the film.</p>
                
                <p>Take as many notes as possible, but at the same time, don't take so many notes that you're not watching the film.</p>
                
                <p>Remember that films are texts that relay an overarching message. Possible to not know what the message is until the end of the film, which may change how you read certain things.</p>
                
                <p>Possible that there is no message to a film. Would have to articulate that message through various signs if doing a semiotic analysis.</p>

                <h3>Movie Notes</h3>
                
                <p>Lebowski - "The Dude"</p>
                
                <p>Tumbleweed rolling along wilderness, city street, beach.</p>
            
                <p>Lebowski himself seens decrepit, living alone in a bachelor pad 'The seat is up'. At odds with his supposed wealth? 'This is a millionare? Looks like a loser to me.'</p>
                
                <p>Bowling alley and overall aesthetics, gaudy wallpaper, etc. very early 90's. Reminiscent of a slightly different time.</p>
                
                <p>Lebowski wears a robe and undergarments everywhere, seemingly. The same thing everywhere?</p>
                
                <p>Degrees, key of the city, pictures with notable people. Signs that the other Lebowski is an upstanding and successful man.</p>
                
                <p>Lebowski is not a nice man despite all these accolades.</p>
                
                <p>The 'dude' nomer is very at odds with Lebowski's high class surroundings.</p>
                
                <p>Pauses before calling him a bum to find out if he has a job. Once he finds out he doesn't have a job he lets free with the scoldings with 'bum'.</p>
                
                <p>'Some chinaman took my legs from me in Korea' (lol)</p>
                
                <p>He has a stereotypical trophy wife that is willing to sleep around. Implication here is that the wife married him for his money.</p>
                
                <p>'He doesn't care about anything. He's a nihilist.'</p>
                
                <p>'I think the dog's a Pomeranian' it is most certainly not a Pomeranian. Ex wife's dog.</p>
                
                <p>please don't pull out a gun over a bowling frame oh my god</p>
                
                <p>'You're not wrong, Walter. You're just an asshole.'</p>
                
                <p>'Take it easy is your answer for everything.'</p>
                
                <p>'Life of achievement, obstacles overcome... what makes a man?'</p>
                
                <p>'Is it being prepared to do the right thing no matter the cost? Isn't that what makes a man' 'That and a pair of testicles'</p>
                
                <p>Dimly lit room in front of a fire</p>
                
                <p>'Strong men also cry'</p>
                
                <p>Ransom note even though it is faxed is written in the stereotypical magazine clipping way. Surely it would be easier to just type it?</p>
                
                <p>Culprits might be the same people tha tpissed on the dude's rug.</p>
                
                <p>Back to bowling tourney. The next people are people with fancy outfits and this is meant to communicate that they are good at bowling.</p>
                
                <p>Playing off that the money is easy money even though he has a beeper. Lebowski essentially has dude on beck and call</p>
                
                <p>That's just like your opinion man</p>
                
                <p>Walter's plan to swindle the kidnappers goes awry terribly, unannounced gun makes a lot of noise, destroys their car and the people to collect the money hightail it in response.</p>
                
                <p>Lebowski's daughter is an artist who makes very suggestive female-centric art. Also the implication is that she is also upper class, through her accent and her extravagant setup.</p>
                
                <p>'Does the female form make you uncomfortable Mr. Lebowski?' Dude has absolutely no idea how to answer this question. 'Is that what this is a picture of?'</p>
                
                <p>Bunnie is a nymphomaniac - connection? (Actually pornstar). Jackie Treehorn is the guy mentioned by the mooks at the beginning of the movie. He is a porn director.</p>
                
                <p>The abduction could be a setup from Bunnie. She is sleeping with the man who was mentioned.</p>
                
                <p>Gives him the number for a doctor.</p>
                
                <p>Royal 'we' lol</p>
                
                <p>'She kidnapped herself'</p>
                
                <p>Envelope - contains gauze? And a cut off toe painted with the same nail polish that she previously asked dude to blow on.</p>
                
                <p>Next shot shows Dude's feet first. Juxtaposition to show the threat Lebowski made to him.</p>
                
                <p>why is he listening to whale noises oh my god</p>
                
                <p>WHY DO THE INTRUDERS HAVE A FERRET. they have german accent - using Johnson, same terminology as Lebowski's daughter. Threat is made.</p>
                
                <p>'My only hope is the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans cut my dick off'</p>
                
                <p>Dude's car is very similar to him, run down, discoloured barely functional.</p>
                
                <p>Why did he mention his briefcase. He looks and is unemployed. The implication is that he's lying about the briefcase or is withholding information.</p>
                
                <p>While the police is around, Lebowski's daughter tells dude that he is the one that took the rug.</p>
                
                <p>The car is stolen by a kid named Larry. Walter destroys the wrong car in the altercation.</p>
                
                <P>Dude attempts to make a barricade for the door on the inside. It doesn't woek because the door is a push from the inside. He later trips over it.</P>
                
                <p>"The brain is the biggest erogenous zone"</p>
                
                <p>Jackie Treehorn wants to meet Dude, Bunnie ran away form him to avoid paying off a debt. Very extravagant place, he is wearing a wedding ring.</p>
                
                <p>Dude gets drugged. "All the dude ever wanted was his rug back."</p>
            
                <p>Porn scene intro. Maude = Leboaski's daughter I guess?</p>
                
                <p>Wakes up in a police station in Malibu, gets ejected. On the way back passes Bunnie and she is actually missing her toe.</p>
                
                <p>why is maude here anyway they had sex i guess</p>
                
                <P>why does she want a child with the dude</P>
                
                <p>"I don't want the father to have any interest in raising the child himself."</p>
                
                <p>Dude wants Walter to pick him up, but it's Sabbath.  Needs to go to Pasadena.</p>
                
                <p>VW Beetle following him around. Brother Seamus is also a  private eye. He owns the car. Thinks he's playing both sides for a profit.</p>
                
                <p>Bunnie's real name is (smth) Knutzen. Ran away a year ago before finding Lebowski.</p>
                
                <p>Germans in a diner. One is also missing a toe - and it's recent.</p>
                
                <p>Lebowski set Dude up ? So the kidnappers would kill Bunnie? Some money needed to disappear and Dude was the best schmuck to pin it on.</p>
                
                <p>"You're not even Jewish, you're Polish catholic."</p>
                
                <p>They run into Bunnie's car, crashed into a fountain. She never ran away, "just went to visit friends in Palm Springs"</p>
                
                <p>walter don't do that</p>
                
                <p>YThe Germans accost them outside of the bowling alley. They set his car on fire. They know there's no hostage but they want the money away. Walter bites one of the German's ears off and Donnie gets shot/has a heart attack (?) anyway he dies</p>
                
                <P>Stars</P>
                
                <p>Someone died. (Why are they wearing sunglasses indoors?) They collect the ashes in a coffee tin because they're too cheap for anything else. They go to the ocean to scatter the ashes because he was a surfer. The ashes blow back into the Dude's face and he snaps. Walter hugs him.</p>
                
                <P>We see the narrator for the first time back at the bowling alley. "The Dude abides"</P>
