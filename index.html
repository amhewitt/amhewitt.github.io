    <p>Hey! I'm Adam Hewitt. I'm a Computer Science major currently in his third year at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in humans, computers, the ways humans use computers, and linguistics, among other things.</p>
      
    <p>This page serves as a hub to all of the places you can reach me, as well as a house for me to place my <a href="notes/notesl.html">lecture notes</a> in the hopes that they're helpful to someone out there.</p>
      
    <p>(There's not much here at the moment. It's a work in progress.)</p>
