      <p>Hey! I'm Adam Hewitt, a Mathematics/Computer science student who's finishing 
        his 2A term at the University of Waterloo. I'm in co-op, and 
        will be starting work at NexJ Systems as a QA Analyst in January.</p>
      
      <p>I have experience with Java, C, HTML, CSS, and Python, and am working on 
        fluency in SQL, C++, and the command line (and all the lovely bits that
        entails).</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not coding, I'm investing my energy into being passionate about
        video games, music, psychology, and Korean food.</p>
      
      <p>(There's not much here at the moment. It's a work in progress.)</p>
